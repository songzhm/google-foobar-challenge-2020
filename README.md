## Journey

Welcome to foobar version 1-293-g571b8be-beta (2020-03-26T07:22:02.968541)

Google has a code challenge ready for you.

>Success! You've managed to infiltrate Commander Lambda's evil organization, and finally earned yourself an entry-level position as a Minion on her space station. From here, you just might be able to subvert her plans to use the LAMBCHOP doomsday device to destroy Bunny Planet. Problem is, Minions are the lowest of the low in the Lambda hierarchy. Better buck up and get working, or you'll never make it to the top...

> Next time Bunny HQ needs someone to infiltrate a space station to rescue prisoners, you're going to tell them to make sure 'stay up for 48 hours straight scrubbing toilets' is part of the job description. It's only fair to warn people, after all.

New challenge "The cake is not a lie!" added to your home folder.
Time to solve: 48 hours.
